this is a model for snap food dataset which contains 21 different food categories and the model must classify the input pics and says what food this is. unfortunately link of this dataset is not avaiable at the time im writing this.
my model can predict with a solid 80% accuracy what food this is but unfortunately i couldnt upload the 160mb model file ;)
